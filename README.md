`Hexify` is a command-line tool written in Go that generates a colored hex dump of a file. It supports custom width, line limits, and pattern highlighting, and it can output the result to a file.

## Features üí°

- Display the hexadecimal representation of a file.
- Highlight specific byte patterns in the hex dump (e.g., "MZ" header).
- Set the width of each line and limit the number of lines.
- Save the hex dump to a file, without ANSI color codes.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To install the hexify tool, you can simply use the following commands.

### Windows
```bash
go install -v "github.com/yourpwnguy/hexify/cmd/hexify@latest"
```

### Linux
```bash
go install -v "github.com/yourpwnguy/hexify/cmd/hexify@latest"

# Do the below step only if your "~/go/bin" is not in PATH
cp ~/go/bin/refine /usr/local/bin/
```

## But Why Use Our Tool‚ùì 

I know there are many hex dump tools available (especially gui ones), but here's why I created Hexify: I wanted to understand how hex dumpers work under the hood, and I noticed a lack of flexible, easy-to-use hex dump CLI tools for Windows. With `Hexify`, you get a tool that‚Äôs simple, customizable, and designed to fit seamlessly into your workflow. Whether you're highlighting patterns, customizing output widths, or saving results to a file, `Hexify` is built to give you the control you need, without the bloat.
